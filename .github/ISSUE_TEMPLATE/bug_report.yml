        Enable internal debugging to capture detailed diagnostic information.
        This helps us understand what logly is doing internally and resolve your issue faster.
        
        **How to enable:**
        ```rust
        let mut config = LoggerConfig::default();
        config.debug_mode = true;
        config.debug_log_file = Some(PathBuf::from("logly_debug.log"));
        logger.configure(config);
        // ... your code that reproduces the issue ...
        ```
        
        Then paste the contents of `logly_debug.log` below, or attach the file to this issue.
      placeholder: |
        Paste your debug log contents here...
        
        Or drag and drop the logly_debug.log file into this text box.
        
        Debug logs include:
        - Logger initialization details
        - Configuration changes
        - Sink operations (add, remove, enable, disable)
        - Log operation details
        - Internal errors and warnings
