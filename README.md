Logly is a simple logging utility for rust that provides an easy way to log messages with different levels, colors, and options. It is designed to be flexible, allowing you to customize the log messages based on your application's needs. Logly supports logging to both the console and a file, and it comes with built-in color-coded log levels for better visibility.

logly.start_logging("test_log.txt"); //start storing the log messages in txt, make sure to pass to create the log file

logly.info("Key1", "Value1", LogColor::Cyan); // message with custom color if you don't want just set it None
logly.warn("Key2", "Value2", LogColor::Yellow);

logly.stop_logging(); //this will stop storing the message from here but it will display
logly.warn("Key3", "Value3", LogColor::Yellow);
